**System Cost:** As discussed in the text, it is important for miniaturized systems to not only maintain or exceed the typical performance of their laboratory-based counterparts but to do so in an affordable and therefore accessible manner. Within the BETTER criteria, the Grade 1 system cost is comparable to a laboratory-based [Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC](https://www.agilent.com/en/product/liquid-chromatography/hplc-systems/analytical-hplc-systems/1260-infinity-ii-lc-system) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Grade 2 and 3 reflect the likely costs of the prototypes presented to date. Grade 4 and 5 are to be set as a benchmark for future prototypes. For this aspect of the framework to be successful, future prototypes should engage in a level of disclosure to allow non-biased assessment of each system. It is important to note that system cost, if not provided, is estimated using one off costs of the major components required in the system. One-off costs at list price, in contrast to volume pricing, better reflects the investment necessary for a research group to replicate the system or device.

**Cost per test:** In the current climate, HPLC tests in centralised laboratories are on the order of $10s to $100s US. While the cost per test is subjective and heavily dependent on the type of analysis being undertaken, the BETTER criteria aims to encourage innovative means of analysis which compete with centralised laboratories. For example, as mentioned in the text, green solvent replacements can reduce running costs potentially 10-fold with only minor sacrifices in performance.

**Weight:** Once again, the Grade 1 weight is in line with a commercial Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC. The goal of this criterion is to encourage the field to account for externalities which will affect the end-user’s ability to perform HPLC anywhere including solvent/waste reservoirs, computer/controller, power source, and consumables. The weight of these externalities significantly affects the overall weight of the prototype and must be considered in order to allow fair and impartial comparisons.

**Portability:** Portability describes the size and form factor of the prototype. It is important to identify this criterion as it allows application-specific systems to arise with features to suit various utilisations. For instance, a particular system may fit into a backpack and may be suitable for use in a remote location such as the Australian Outback. Whereas, another system may be attached to a scrambler motorbike to be used as a portable laboratory. Prototypes reported within the past decade fall into the Grade 3 and 4 categories. 

**Operation time:** The majority of prototypes presented to date quote an operation time away from mains power between a full working day (Grade 1) up to 24 hours (Grade 2). These can be seen as standard and realistic estimates given that frequent recharging is inconvenient would reduce throughput. System operating times of up to one week, one month, and beyond one month are set as the benchmarks for Grades 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Future prototypes should include operation time using battery power as a standard test alongside analytical performance. 

**Robustness Testing:** Thus far, with the exception of [Chatzimichail et al.](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9AN01302D), robustness testing has been overlooked by the field. Given that the end-goal of portable HPLC is to perform HPLC anywhere, it is surprising to find that durability and robustness testing of prototypes while in operation is not reported. The field should aim to at minimum adhere to the Grade 4 criterion in which the system is ‘resistant to shock impacts during operation’. Without meeting this criterion, portable HPLC would become a very expensive feat.

**Performance:** The chromatographic performance of the prototypes is classified according to the elution type and operating pressures. Grade 1 and 2 describe systems with attainable pressures of < 50 bar and ≤ 200 bar, respectively, while Grade 3 and 4 are dedicated to systems capable of up to 600 and 1300 bar, respectively. Grade 5 refers to systems with operating pressures above 1300 bar. We acknowledge that this grading may alter with advances in miniaturised pumping technology; however, at this time, we believe that the framework accurately describes the performance of current prototypes.

**Waste Production:** The volume and handling of HPLC waste are important factors which must be considered for portable prototypes. Ensuring responsible disposal of large volumes of hazardous waste can become expensive, time-consuming, and inconvenient. Grade 1 is in line with the waste produced by a laboratory based HPLC which require specialist disposal.  Grade 5 represents the ideal aim of a portable HPLC: < 100 mL/day non-hazardous waste disposed of in ordinary waste or recycling streams. To date, many prototypes report low waste production in line with Grade 4; however, no systems are yet to report non-hazardous waste production.
