# BETTER Framework for the Assessment of Portable HPLC Instruments

**_TL;DR_**: BETTER helps to assess the development of Portable HPLC instumentation.

## What is BETTER?
The BETTER (porta**B**le fi**E**ld **T**esting s**T**andard fram**E**wo**R**k) criteria 2020 act as a framework to facilitate more objective comparisons, encourage better reporting, and act as a development framework for the portable HPLC community. BETTER 2020 endeavours to account for non-chromatographic characteristics (e.g. costs, robustness), along with often-neglected requirements with considerable impact on a system’s field-applicability (portability, solvent requirements, etc). Levels are often defined by usability: for example, whether a system can realistically be carried on a by hand or in a backpack, might be more relevant to a user than any other more specific variable.

## Where can I find the BETTER assessments?
Portable HPLC systems published in the scientific literature between 1980 and 2020 have been assessed and can be found on the [**BETTER assessments page**](https://github.com/BETTER-HPLC/better-hplc.github.io/blob/master/better-2020/better-2020-assessments.md).

## What do the BETTER grades mean?
The full framework can be found on the [**BETTER criteria page**](https://github.com/BETTER-HPLC/better-hplc.github.io/blob/master/better-2020/better-2020-criteria.md). BETTER grade levels (each ranging from 1 to 5) are selected both to represent the current range of developments, and community goals. To date, portable LC systems meet some of the grade 2 and 3 criteria. The grade 4 and 5 criteria should be seen as a challenge to be met by next generation devices; indeed, no instrument reported to date reaches Grade 5 in any category. 

## How do I use BETTER?
These ratings are intended to help you assess a system required to perform chromatography *as a whole*. We note that many factors are not addressed in original publications. These “externalities” often include: solvent reservoirs; computer/controller; power source; and consumables. For example, in the case of a miniature instrument which weighs 250g, but which requires a robust power supply to operate in the field, the weight should not be assessed purely on the basis of the instrument, but the whole system. Lacking the relevant data, and to allow objective comparison, we make estimates of the additional weight of components required to maintain the instrument in operation for the stated "operation time away from the laboratory", along with the mass of solvent required. We have used information that is available in the relevant academic publications and where information is missing or not reported we have endeavoured to make assumptions in good faith. 

## How do I contribute?
Are you an instrument developer, builder or user? Have you recently reported a new instrument? Did we miss yours in the literature? (sorry, we didn't mean to!) Would you like to submit new data? If any of these apply to you then we'd encourage you get in touch. This public GitHub repository of the current BETTER standards, and notes on assessment, will be maintained to make this a sustainable endeavour. Additionally, we encourage the submission of accurate and complete data to the repository.
